  abstract            = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a promising technology for addressing societal challenges by connecting smart devices and leveraging Big Data analytics to create smart cities worldwide. As the IoT scales up, it's important to provide interoperability among different devices. Yet current simple standard protocols lack sufficient openness and interoperability. IoT for smart cities needs to guarantee the accessibility of open data and cloud services to allow industries and citizens to develop new services and applications. Here, the authors provide a case study of the GreenIoT platform in Uppsala, Sweden, to demonstrate the idea of interoperability and open data for smart cities. © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract            = {The urban development vision that is 'smart city' is fast becoming a target of modern cities. However, it is hard to find a general reference architecture and interoperability standards to help with the effective realization of such a vision. This paper sets o ut to do two things: first, we look to develop a general model of city structure, and then we suggest a smart city interoperability framework based on it. For the city model two modeling skills were applied; infrastructure-oriented modeling of a system and the value flows within the system. The skills support modeling of a city at a manageable level of granularity and the handling of emerging ICT functions of smart city at the same level, an infrastructure. Derived high level architecture model of a smart city integration is general enough to use for the development of interoperability framework of smart city. A process of selecting preferable smart city services is formulated, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of interoperability framework; it is necessary effort, since smart city is on a convergence technology that should be leaded by the virtue of the convergence, the effectiveness of innovation. Based on both researches on the infrastructure-oriented modeling of a city and service prioritization, we developed a smart city interoperability framework conforming to a practical ICT infrastructure system as an efficient and effective vehicle of smart city realization. © 2016 IEEE.},

The modeling and analysis techniques were used to create models of the people, processes, and technologies of the program and to represent the way demands were placed on this complex socio-technical system. Analysis of the models revealed interoperability risks that were manifested in the linkages between operational requirements of functional capabilities and the way in which those capabilities were being maintained. The risks identified in this probe were typed as mission, composition, and performance risks. The structural models produced by the techniques bring a welcome engineering rigor to the process of examining interoperability.},

  abstract                = {Smart cities have become a reality around the world. They rely on wireless communication technologies, and they have provided many benefits to society, such as monitoring road traffic in real-time, giving continuous healthcare assistance to residents and managing the environment. This article revisits key interoperability questions in heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple, modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture is composed by sensing, access network, Internet/cloud and application layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security, have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover). Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring delays from the proposed low cost sunspot/mesh and arduino/mesh gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed. Significant results from simulations allow the analysis of the reliability on vehicular/mesh networks under jamming attacks by applying the OLSR and MP-OLSR routing protocols. Finally, this article provides an overview of open research questions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The insight of the smart urban is extensively preferred, as it improves the excellence of life of citizens, connecting several regulations, that is, smart transportation, smart parking, smart environment, smart healthcare, and so forth. Continuous intensification of the multifaceted urban set-up is extensively challenged by real-time processing of data and smart decision capabilities. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a smart city architecture which is based on Big Data analytics. The proposed scheme is comprised of three modules: (1) data acquisition and aggregation module collects varied and diverse data interrelated to city services, (2) data computation and processing module performs normalization, filtration, processing and data analysis, and (3) application and decision module formulates decisions and initiates events. The proposed architecture is a generic solution for the smart urban planning and variety of datasets is analyzed to validate this architecture. In addition, we tested reliable datasets on Hadoop server to verify the threshold limit value (TLV) and the investigation demonstrates that the proposed scheme offer valuable imminent into the community development systems to get better the existing smart urban architecture. Moreover, the efficiency of proposed architecture in terms of throughput is also shown. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In the context of SoS, the issue of interoperability is crucial especially when integrating multiple heterogeneous and independently governed systems. Any solution is naturally applied to resolve a problem in a precise context, where context specificities are implicitly or explicitly processed. In the scope of this paper, we tackle the problem of SoS interoperability knowledge description taking into account the notion of context. To structure this description, we propose ontology design patterns (ODPs) that describe the notion of 'context' in the field of SoS Interoperability. These ODPs was defined based on a Foundational Ontology (FO) for 'Context' description. An example in the field of Traffic management is given to illustrate the practical usefulness of the proposed ontology. © 2014 IEEE.},

Interoperability is one of these characteristics (both functional and non-functional), which is from our point of view, essential in order to guarantee the control of the SoS, its behavior and the fulfillment of its mission(s). Moreover, it ensures the reaction of the SoS to deal with some risky situations and with potential local or global deficits during its functioning. In this paper, we propose to determine the relation between the current level of interoperability of the SoS and its functioning whatever may be its situation. A matrix shows how this relation evolves taking into account several characteristics of the SoS, particularly its capacity to respect interoperability requirements (Compatibility, Interoperation, Autonomy and Reversibility) and the so-called analysis perspectives of the SoS: Performance, Integrity and Stability. This relation is requested in order to permit and to guide SoS behavioral simulation currently in development. Thus, a set of indicators is derived and formalized. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

  abstract            = {Modern Information and Communication Technologies are definitely a key factor to develop the green and sustainable applications that the so-called 'smart city' needs. Effective management of resources, gathering and interpreting data as well as ecological considerations are prerequisites to turn such a vision into reality. The European FP7 project DIMMER address these issues by providing a flexible Internet of Thing platform for application development and data integration, exploiting information about buildings, energy distribution grids and user behaviors. Among those applications, the possibility to real-time access and aggregate information about building environmental characteristics and energy consumption enables the optimization of energy management and control, as well as the user's awareness about, which is the scope of the DIMMER project. The paper will describe the ontology-driven approach, as well as the actual design, exploited to model the physical world within the context of this project, adding a special emphasis on the state of art research in the field of energy profiling. © 2016 University of Split, FESB.},

These systems have attracted different types of research including project management, technological implications as well as educational research. With the new data era, it is key that studies complementing ERP and Big Data integration are well established. During the initial stage of literature analysis, it was found that interoperability was an important aspect in ERP and Big Data integration. However, there were limited studies linking ERP, Big Data and Interoperability. A thorough background analysis was therefore performed to understand state-of-the-art linking these three domains and the results are presented in this paper. First, the link between ERP, Big Data and Interoperability is discussed. Second, the main findings from the articles linking ERP, Big Data and Interoperability are highlighted. Finally, the research areas linking these three domains are derived. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract                = {Typically, smart city projects involve complex distributed systems having multiple stakeholders and diverse applications. These applications involve a multitude of sensor and IoT platforms for managing different types of timeseries observations. In many scenarios, timeseries data is the result of specific simulations and is stored in databases and even simple files. To make well-informed decisions, it is essential to have a proper data integration strategy, which must allow working with heterogeneous data sources and platforms in interoperable ways. In this paper, we present a new lightweight web service called InterSensor Service allowing to simply connect to multiple IoT platforms, simulation specific data, databases, and simple files and retrieving their observations without worrying about data storage and the multitude of different APIs. The service encodes these observations “on-the-fly” according to the standardized external interfaces such as the OGC Sensor Observation Service and OGC SensorThings API. In this way, the heterogeneous observations can be analyzed and visualized in a unified way. The service can be deployed not only by the users to connect to different sources but also by providers and stakeholders to simply add further interfaces to their platforms realizing interoperability according to international standards. We have developed a Java-based implementation of the InterSensor Service, which is being offered free as open source software. The service is already being used in smart city projects and one application for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper. © 2019 by the authors.

  abstract            = {Today's big data era is described by intense variety in data management systems, query languages and programming paradigms. Each system targets well a specific application area, reinforcing the belief that the era of one-size fits all has gone. Interoperability, systems' connectivity and high-level data models become once again the core of research initiatives. In this paper we present our vision for a layered architecture to support interoperability among different data management systems, generalized under the term data management entities (DMEs). DMEs range from JVMs running Java programs to Hadoop systems employing complex MapReduce jobs to traditional RDBMS running SQL queries to stream engines and CEP scripts. The top layer consists of a universe of DMEs, communicating through a well defined http-like protocol: a DME transparently invokes another DME's data manipulation task, regardless task's nature. Communicating DMEs share/operate on a shared data object, a key-value set (KVS) - just a set of key-value pairs-which exists in the layer below and is referenced through a unique (internet-wide) address via a well-defined API. This layer serves as the transient common memory space for communicating DMEs and consists of globally addressable KVSs, organized in domains, sub-domains, etc. In a way, this approach constitutes a form of remote procedure call by reference (the KVS is the common reference). We argue that this architecture allows the construction of high level query languages and cost-based distributed query processing engines, involving completely heterogeneous data manipulation tasks. For example, we show that MapReduce evaluation algorithm and distributed relational query processing are just instances of the proposed architecture. We also claim that it can easily facilitate the end-to-end processing in big data applications, an established goal in the research agenda set by the Beckman report. © 2016, Copyright is with the authors.},

  abstract                = {In February 2005, 61 countries around the World agreed on a 10 year plan to build open systems for sharing geospatial data and services across different platforms worldwide. This system is known as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The objective of GEOSS focuses on easy access to environmental data and interoperability across different systems allowing participating countries to measure the "pulse" of the planet in an effort to advance society. In support of GEOSS goals, NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) has developed radar visualization and data exporter tools using Open Source software libraries. The NCDC Interactive Radar Viewer and Data Exporter Toolkit load Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) volume scan (S-band) data, known as Level-II, and derived products, known as Level-III, into an OPEN Geographical Information System (GIS) compliant environment. The application is launched via Java Web Start and runs on the client machine while accessing these data remotely from the NCDC archive or in near real time from other NOAA servers. The Radar Interactive Viewer Toolkit provides custom data overlays, animations and basic queries. The export of images and movies is provided in multiple formats that support the "blending" of radar data with other types of data. The Data Exporter allows for data export in both vector polygon (Shapefile, Well-Known Text) and raster (GeoTIFF, ESRI Grid, VTK, NetCDF, GrADS) formats. NCDC recently decoded Sigmet C-band doppler radar data and plans to implement the functionality to read C-Band radar data into the Radar Viewer/Data Exporter Toolkit. This supports a bilateral agreement between the United States and Canada for data sharing and interoperability. In addition, the NCDC is implementing decoders to read a test bed of distributed X- band radars that are funded through the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) project. This paper describes in further detail the NCDC Radar Visualization and Data Exporter Tools, and the NCDC hopes to establish collaboration with scientists participating in GEOSS to leverage these tools for interoperable use with other global radar networks. © 2008 ASCE.},

This novel and efficient approach to a long-standing problem concentrates on the relationships between models to provide a framework and factorization of an SoS architecture for portfolio selection and evaluation. The approach is demonstrated in a simplified, but end-to-end, case study derived from the original data link interoperability analysis.

Joint Vision relies on system of systems to bridge participant systems with interoperability as a key enabler. To achieve this key enabler, this paper discusses the need for interoperability implementation at the programmatic, constructive, and operational levels. The system of systems interoperability must take into account its unbounded characteristics and engineer constituent systems for syntactic and semantic interoperability and to be system of systems enabled for an omnipresent environment. This paper demonstrates why systems must be managed and engineered as system of systems centric versus systems centric.

We present cases showing how this approach is leveraged for big data analysis.
Methods: To support the assertion that semi-structured narrative in CDA format can be a useful adjunct in an overall big data analytic approach, we present two case studies. The first assesses an organization’s ability to generate clinical quality reports using coded data alone vs. coded data supplemented by CDA narrative. The second leverages CDA to construct a network model for referral management, from which additional observations can be gleaned.
Results: The first case shows that coded data supplemented by CDA narrative resulted in significant variances in calculated performance scores. In the second case, we found that the constructed network model enables the identification of differences in patient characteristics among different re -ferral work flows.
Discussion: The CDA approach goes after data indirectly, by focusing first on the flow of narrative, which is then incrementally structured. A quantitative assessment of whether this approach will lead to a greater flow of data and ultimately a greater flow of structured data vs. other approaches is planned as a future exercise.
Conclusion: Along with growing adoption of CDA, we are now seeing the big data community explore the standard, particularly given its potential to supply analytic engines with volumes of data previously not possible. © Schattauer 2015.},

  abstract                = {The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is built on current international cooperation efforts among existing distributed earth observing and processing systems. The goal is to formulate an end-to-end process that enables the collection and distribution of accurate, reliable earth observation (EO) data, information, products, and services to both suppliers and consumers worldwide. EOs are obtained from a multitude of sources and require tremendous efforts and coordination among different governments and user groups to come to a shared understanding on a set of concepts involved in a domain. Semantic metadata play a crucial role in resolving the differences in meaning, interpretation, and usage of the same or related data. Also, the knowledge about the geopolitical background of the originating datasets could be encoded in the metadata that would address the diversity on a global scale. In distributed environments like GEOSS, modularization is inevitable. In this paper, we describe the need for an information semantics-based approach for knowledge management and interoperability between heterogeneous GEOSS systems. Further, considering the magnitude of concepts involved in GEOSS, we explore the possibility of using modular ontologies for formulating smaller interconnected ontologies. © 2008 IEEE.},

However, it is difficult to understand the network wide impacts of changes to the system of systems. The DoD has had difficulty managing this system of systems due to the scale and complexity of the network and traditional systems engineering tools do not provide necessary insights for DoD decision makers. This paper proposes applying social network analysis to understand the interoperability associated with the DoD system of systems. It applies several centrality metrics to a network of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) to quantify the interoperability of individual systems within the system of systems. Specifically, it examines the differences between the degree, closeness, and eigenvector centrality metrics to identify which metric best represents the interoperability of individual systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

To help them, crisis cells are set up at the moment the news of crisis is released and actually have only the time to centralize decisions. The purpose of the French ANR (French National Agency for Research) GéNéPi project is to permit interoperability, through supporting coordination and data sharing: inside the decisional level, between hierarchical echelons, and inside the operational level, between the stakeholders. A MIS (Mediation Information System) is provided by this project and encompasses: (i) the information analysis, on the basis of data collected during the preparation phase, (ii) the creation of one collaborative process and (iii) the agility of the solution by comparing two situation models on run-time. Such a system needs to deal with Big Data issues in order to be able to evaluate these models. The paper presents the context of the research and the improvements brought by the MIS. It also expresses the possibility of and the need for automate the data retrieval, thanks to Big Data methods, so that the MIS could evaluate the field situation in real time. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract            = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the technology and advances of the Internet and every day it is becoming more popular to talk about IoT systems in multiple domains: Smart Cities, Agriculture, and Industrial Internet, etc. Increasingly, IoT systems will need to interact and be interconnected for offering the always-promoted everything-connected paradigm. Current IoT systems rely on semantic web technologies for integrating data and ensure web services interoperability. However there are yet a gap to ensure semantic interoperability among IoT systems. Most of the existing proposed (open) approaches and solutions lack on formal methodologies for interoperability in technology and standard format of the data. We studied and analyzed most available semantic-based IoT approaches to identify the main requirements hindering IoT semantic interoperability. In this paper, we present SEG 3.0 a methodology to federate, unify and provide semantic interoperability. SEG 3.0 emerges from methodologies for ontology engineering and the idea of unification and federated systems. We propose SEG 3.0 and apply it to Internet of Things (IoT) and particularly on use cases for smart cities as proof of concept. Firstly, we define characteristics required for the methodology. Secondly, we describe the processes and the different formal steps. Thirdly, we provide a proof of concept framework and architecture applying this methodology, thus the benefits of using SEG 3.0 methodology in IoT domains are described. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEG 3.0 methodology is applied to three use cases: (1) the M3 framework to assist developers in designing semantic-based IoT applications, (2) the VITAL EU project for smart cities, and (3) the FIESTA-IoT EU project for IoT semantic interoperability. SEG 3.0 is a formal methodology generic enough to be applied to other domains than IoT and smart cities, since the main benefit of the SEG 3.0 is integrating heterogeneous data and adding value to it to build innovative applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

The U.S. Defense has evolved systematic ways for their families-of-systems to be progressively more integrated, interoperable and information assured and this is dramatically differentiating its capability assurance from its allies. This paper reports new Markovian testability modelling comparing the abstract efficacy of assurance experimentation and testing strategies employed by Australia Defence against the new U.S. strategies that are now able to quantitatively illustrate the widening gap between these allies.

Many measurements of interoperability of system pairs exist, but an architecture-level method for calculating interoperability of a system of systems is not currently available. This research presents a flexible, intuitive measure of interoperability of system pairs within a potential architecture performing a set of resource exchanges. It draws from reliability theory to incorporate system requirements and to link the interoperability of a system of systems with operational metrics of performance. This measure of interoperability could provide decision makers with information about an architecture and allow them to compare existing and potential systems of systems during the early phases of acquisition. © 2013 IEEE.},

Accordingly, a lexicon and ontology-based approach to data interoperability is offered as a practical and adaptable framework to address challenges of data interoperability presented by big health data analytics and related issues. The use of ontologies as descriptive, heuristic, and normative instruments is presented as means for facilitating data interoperability by ensuring semantic congruity and syntactic conformance within and across large and complex data sets.

Yet, where OGD figure prominently in the vision of a smart city, OGD are, in fact, scarce. From production and distribution practices to file types, organizational structure, and repositories, large quantities of potential OGD remain as legacy data trapped in incumbent systems. This article confronts the challenges of legacy data through a constructivist analysis of data wrangling (i.e., converting data into useful formats). The analysis illustrates that wrangling legacy data is more than a rote technical activity. Our findings suggest that smart governance in practice depends on the ways in which social, organizational, and institutional strategies cope with technical change. Further, our research demonstrates that wrangling legacy data is not a discrete problem to overcome but an operating condition defining the rapidly changing landscape of smart governance. © 2018, © 2018 Urban Affairs Association.},

  abstract            = {Modern cities are supported by many IT systems managed by distinct public and private agents. Such legacy systems are often incompatible since, in general, they use old, dependent and nonstandardised technologies. This results in an environment in which there is no interoperability among smart city systems, preventing richer and more interesting applications to be used by citizens, companies, and city administration. An alternative to solve the lack of interoperability is the adoption of a System-of- Systems (SoS) approach. A SoS is a set of independent and heterogeneous constituent systems that interoperate to accomplish a global mission. The collaboration among such constituent systems enables a SoS to offer new functionalities that cannot be provided by any of these systems working as individual entities. The goal of this paper is to propose SoS-centric middleware services to support the management and execution of SoS in Smart Cities environments in a dynamic, transparent and scalable way. The proposed services, once integrated into a smart city platform, support interoperability among different systems operating in a city. Moreover, this paper also presents a motivational case study to make it clear the issues that must be addressed when multiple independent systems are brought together to provide a new Smart City service or application. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery.},

They define formats and protocols to transmit medical images, signals, and patient data inside and outside hospital facilities. These standards can be implemented but big data expectations are stimulating a new approach, simplifying data collection and interoperability, seeking reduction of time to full implementation inside health organizations. Virtual Medical Record, DICOM Structured Reporting and HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) are changing the way medical data are shared among organization and they will be the keys to big data interoperability.

  abstract                = {While a huge amount of (epi)genomic data of multiple types is becoming available by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, the most important emerging problem is the so-called tertiary analysis, concerned with sense making, e.g., discovering how different (epi)genomic regions and their products interact and cooperate with each other. We propose a paradigm shift in tertiary analysis, based on the use of the Genomic Data Model (GDM), a simple data model which links genomic feature data to their associated experimental, biological and clinical metadata. GDM encompasses all the data formats which have been produced for feature extraction from (epi)genomic datasets. We specifically describe the mapping to GDM of SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), VCF (Variant Call Format), NARROWPEAK (for called peaks produced by NGS ChIP-seq or DNase-seq methods), and BED (Browser Extensible Data) formats, but GDM supports as well all the formats describing experimental datasets (e.g., including copy number variations, DNA somatic mutations, or gene expressions) and annotations (e.g., regarding transcription start sites, genes, enhancers or CpG islands). We downloaded and integrated samples of all the above-mentioned data types and formats from multiple sources. The GDM is able to homogeneously describe semantically heterogeneous data and makes the ground for providing data interoperability, e.g., achieved through the GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL), a high-level, declarative query language for genomic big data. The combined use of the data model and the query language allows comprehensive processing of multiple heterogeneous data, and supports the development of domain-specific data-driven computations and bio-molecular knowledge discovery. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Interoperability programs deliver end-to-end cooperation and collaboration capabilities and services among organizations, users, systems, and infrastructures, on top of a set of existing systems. Each system has its own programmatic and technical constraints and issues. System-level stakeholders usually prefer core functionality over integration, and expect the interconnectivity infrastructure to be transparent and simple, regardless of its actual cost, complexity, or criticality. Hence, coordinating and aligning the multiple system and team efforts in order to reach a synergetic effect is a challenge that many integration professionals in the cyber, energy, manufacturing, and traffic domains are familiar with. Traditional system-centered design methods fail to capture interconnectivity and collaboration aspects and issues, and they are of little interest to the individual systems' stakeholders. The framework we propose is based on Object-Process Methodology, an emerging ISO standard (ISO 19450) for modeling and design of complex, dynamic, and multidisciplinary systems. Our framework facilitates a smooth transition from a set of disparate system-centered views to a consolidated, integrated model, which accounts for integration aspects, interface and payload structure and behavior, interconnectivity processes and services, and eventually emergent interoperability capabilities. © 2013 by Author Name.},

Interoperability challenges call for a model-based systems engineering approach. This paper describes a conceptual modeling framework for model-based interoperability engineering (MoBIE) for systems of systems, which integrates multilayered interoperability specification, modeling, architecting, design, and testing. Treating interoperability infrastructure as a system in its own right, MoBIE facilitates interoperability among agents, processes, systems, services, and interfaces. MoBIE is founded on ISO 19450 standard - object-process methodology, a holistic paradigm for modeling and architecting complex, dynamic, and multidisciplinary systems - and allows for synergistic integration of the interoperability model with system-centric models. We also discuss the implementation of MoBIE with the unified modeling language. We discuss the importance of interoperability in the civil aviation domain, and apply MoBIE to analyze the passenger departure process in an airport terminal as a case-in-point. The resulting model enables architectural and operational decision making and analysis at the system-of-systems level and adds significant value at the interoperability engineering program level. © 2013 IEEE.},

Those systems are constantly evolving and scaling up, involving a wide range of integration among users, devices, utilities, public services and also policies. Modelling such complex dynamic systems’ architectures has always been essential for the development and application of techniques/tools to support design and deployment of integration of new components, as well as for the analysis, verification, simulation and testing to ensure trustworthiness. This article reports on the definition and implementation of a scalable component-based architecture that supports a cooperative energy demand response (DR) system coordinating energy usage between neighbouring households. The proposed architecture, called refinement of Cyber-Physical Component Systems (rCPCS), which extends the refinement calculus for component and object system (rCOS) modelling method, is implemented using Eclipse Extensible Coordination Tools (ECT), i.e., Reo coordination language. With rCPCS implementation in Reo, we specify the communication, synchronisation and co-operation amongst the heterogeneous components of the system assuring, by design scalability and the interoperability, correctness of component cooperation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract                = {An increase of 2.5 billion people is expected in urban areas by 2050, when 66% of the world population will reside here. It is therefore reasonable to assume a parallel growth in the smart city Internet of Things (IoT). A challenge, however, is presented in the interoperability between the devices deployed, limited due to the ad hoc and proprietary ways which systems have been rolled out to date. A standardized network infrastructure specific to the IoT can work towards resolving the challenges. This approach to operation, however, raises questions with regard to how an architecture may support different devices and applications simultaneously, and additionally be extensible to accommodate applications and devices not available at the time of the framework’s development. In this paper, these questions are explored, and an IoT infrastructure which accommodates the interoperability communication constraints and challenges today is proposed. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Successful deployments of IoT have resulted in the military looking at the impacts and benefits of IoT, both for directly leveraging IoT within the military environment as well as to interface with smart city environments for urban operations such as humanitarian assistance and disaster response. This article describes some of the outcomes of the NATO IST-147 Research Task Group that was established to explore the military applications of IoT. Within the NATO context, the concept of federated mission networks (FMNs) enables coalition partners to plan, prepare, establish, use, and terminate mission networks in support of federated operations. In this article, we propose an architecture and data model to enable interoperability between FMN and IoT networks in smart city environments. We review the various bottlenecks involved for such an environment and how a reference implementation can be set up to allow multiple partners to exchange data for sharing resources and provide better situational awareness. The concepts discussed reuse and improvise upon the existing NATO and commercial IoT standards for faster adoption. Finally, open research challenges are discussed as future research directions. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

However, most of the developed systems are custom-tailored solutions for specific problems and application areas, leaving us with a set of diverse frameworks. The resulting jungle of heterogeneous systems makes it difficult to find common interfaces for interconnecting the underlying businesses with each other, especially in regard to Smart City concepts. We envision a new paradigm shift towards “Smart City as a service” fueled by increased interoperability between different services with an additional emphasis on privacy-preserving data processing. This would contribute to a new level of connectivity between the environment, service providers, and people, facilitating our daily activities and enhancing the level of trust of the users. In order to achieve interoperability in the context of smart, connected cities, we propose the design of a generic, platform-independent novel architecture for interconnecting heterogeneous systems, their services, and user pools. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Unfortunately, building a single global ecosystem of Things that communicate with each other seamlessly is virtually impossible today. The reason is that the IoT is essentially a collection of isolated “Intranets of Things”, also referred to as “vertical silos”, which cannot easily and efficiently interact with each other. Smart cities are perhaps the most striking examples of this problem since they comprise a wide range of stakeholders and service providers who must work together, including urban planners, financial organisations, public and private service providers, telecommunication providers, industries, citizens, and so forth. Within this context, the contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) discuss business and technological implications as well as challenges of creating successful open innovation ecosystems, (ii) present the technological building blocks underlying an IoT ecosystem developed in the framework of the EU Horizon 2020 programme, (iii) present a smart city pilot (Heat Wave Mitigation in Métropole de Lyon) for which the proposed ecosystem significantly contributes to improving interoperability between a number of system components, and reducing regulatory barriers for joint service co-creation practices. © 2017 by the authors.

Providing end to end Quality of Service (QoS) for an SOS is a major challenge today because of issues with connectivity, the independent evolution of component systems and their heterogeneity. Heterogeneity of systems is common because of the independent evolution paths and development cycles of the systems. In this paper, we describe an interoperable end to end QoS management solution including concepts, architecture, prototype, and experimental results. Our solution not only provides QoS at systems level, but also ensuring end-to-end QoS across heterogeneous systems at the SOS level. To validate our solution, we analyzed and compared architecture alternatives and developed prototype and experiments employing multiple and varied data dissemination technologies.},

  abstract                = {When designing highly interactive distributed systems such as e-learning environments, a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective enables dynamic adaptation to situations of use and thus user-centeredness during operation. Each system, e.g., a mobile device for accessing a learning management system, can still be operated as a separate system, e.g., displaying the latest feedback from peers, while being run as part of a federated system, e.g., synchronizing a learning group for a tutoring session taking into account individual availability of participants. This type of coupling requires interoperability assurance of systems, in particular federating various devices and cross-over features (e.g., linking learning content to posts on social media platforms) in dynamically evolving environments. We demonstrate the utility of bigraph-based handling of SoS. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the re-specification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We show the potential of this approach orchestrating two distributed and independent systems, with orchestration enabling directly respondence to changes in a federated system's context. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract                = {Interoperability remains a major burden to the developers of Internet of Things systems. It is due to IoT devices are extremely heterogeneous regarding basic communication protocols, data formats, and technologies. Furthermore, due to the absence of worldwide satisfactory standards, Interoperability tools remains imperfect. In this paper, we have proposed Semantic Interoperability Model for Big-data in IoT (SIMB-IoT) to deliver semantic interoperability among heterogeneous IoT devices in health care domain. This model is used to recommend medicine with side effects for different symptoms collected from heterogeneous IoT sensors. Two datasets are taken for the analysis of big-data. One dataset contains diseases with drug details and the second dataset contains medicines with side effects. Information between physician and patient are semantically annotated and transferred in a meaningful way. A Lightweight Model for Semantic annotation of Big-data using heterogeneous devices in IoT is proposed to provide annotations for big data. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a semantic web framework that is recycled to communicate things using Triples to make it semantically significant. RDF annotated patients’ data and made it semantically interoperable. SPARQL query is used to extract records from RDF graph. Tableau, Gruff-6.2.0, and Mysql tools are used in simulation in this article. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Those systems not only need to be operated as separate systems (e.g., optimizing each transport modality in supply networks), but also are required to capture complex situations as interconnected entity (e.g., adapting a transport chain involving different modalities according to weather conditions). SoS can handle such challenges through emerging behavior, while letting each of the involved systems operate separately. The latter property requires interoperability of systems that can be preserved even in dynamically changing environments applying the theory of bigraphs. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the respecification of these systems through behavior adaptations.

However, interconnection of the Smart city systems still is a challenging process due to incompatibility of systems that apply a plenty of appropriate technical solutions and protocols that cause collaboration between automation devices such as sensors, actuators, controllers. Introduction of Internet-of-Things (IoT) provides promising opportunities to develop new services and integrate different application domains. The Arrowhead Framework aims to apply Service Oriented Architecture to the embedded systems' world. This research is focused on the one of the Arrowhead Framework core systems - Event Handler. This system supports the handling of events, and enriches service-oriented applications with the capabilities of interacting via the publish/subscribe paradigm. We implemented the Event Handler system as a MQTT enabled service broker, and deployed data flow programming tool Node-RED for wiring together divergent hardware devices and nodes, and APIs for online services. A case study of the service broker implemented for control of utilities systems in urban environment is presented and discussed. © 2018 IEEE.},
